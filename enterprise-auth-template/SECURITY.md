## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 🔐 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:
- **Email**: security@your-organization.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Enterprise Auth Template - Brief Description

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots demonstrating the issue
5. **Suggested Fix**: Any suggestions for remediation (if available)
6. **Environment**: Version, configuration, and environment details

### Example Report Format

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Enterprise Auth Template - JWT Token Validation Issue

Description:
The JWT token validation process in the authentication middleware 
does not properly verify token expiration, allowing expired tokens 
to be accepted.

Impact:
High - Attackers could potentially use expired tokens to gain 
unauthorized access to protected resources.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Authenticate and obtain a JWT token
2. Wait for token to expire (or manually set expiration in past)
3. Use expired token to access protected endpoint /api/user/profile
4. Request succeeds despite expired token

Proof of Concept:
[Include code or screenshots]

Environment:
- Version: 1.0.0
- Backend: FastAPI
- Authentication: JWT
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

When deploying the Enterprise Authentication Template:

1. **Environment Security**
   ```bash
   # Always use strong, unique passwords
   export POSTGRES_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   export JWT_SECRET_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 64)"
   export REDIS_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
   ```

2. **SSL/TLS Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Always use HTTPS in production
   export USE_HTTPS=true
   export SSL_CERT_PATH="/path/to/ssl/cert.pem"
   export SSL_KEY_PATH="/path/to/ssl/key.pem"
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   ```bash
   # Use dedicated database users with limited permissions
   export POSTGRES_USER="app_user"  # Not 'postgres' or 'admin'
   export POSTGRES_DB="auth_prod"   # Dedicated database
   ```

4. **Rate Limiting**
   ```bash
   # Configure appropriate rate limits
   export RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN="5/minute"
   export RATE_LIMIT_API="100/minute"
   ```

### For Developers

When contributing to the project:

1. **Code Security**
   - Never commit secrets or API keys
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Regularly audit dependencies
   cd backend && safety check
   cd frontend && npm audit
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```bash
   # Include security tests
   pytest tests/security/ -v
   ```

## 🔍 Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT with secure token rotation
   - OAuth2 with PKCE
   - WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Session management and timeout

2. **Input Protection**
   - Pydantic validation (backend)
   - Zod validation (frontend)
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection
   - CSRF protection

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Configurable rate limits per endpoint
   - Distributed rate limiting with Redis
   - Account lockout protection
   - Brute force protection

4. **Security Headers**
   ```python
   # Automatically configured security headers
   - Content-Security-Policy
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
   ```

5. **Audit Logging**
   - All authentication events logged
   - Failed login attempt tracking
   - Administrative action logging
   - Compliance-ready audit trails

### Security Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.prod.yml security settings
security_opt:
  - no-new-privileges:true
  - seccomp:unconfined
read_only: true
cap_drop:
  - ALL
cap_add:
  - CHOWN
  - SETGID
  - SETUID
```

## 🔧 Security Hardening

### Production Deployment

1. **Container Security**
   ```dockerfile
   # Use non-root user
   RUN adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser
   USER appuser
   
   # Set read-only filesystem
   RUN chmod -R 755 /app
   ```

2. **Network Security**
   ```yaml
   # Isolate services with Docker networks
   networks:
     frontend:
       driver: bridge
     backend:
       driver: bridge
       internal: true
   ```

3. **Environment Isolation**
   ```bash
   # Use secrets management
   docker secret create jwt_secret jwt_secret.txt
   docker secret create db_password db_password.txt
   ```

### Monitoring & Alerting

1. **Security Events**
   - Failed authentication attempts
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Suspicious API usage patterns
   - Configuration changes

2. **Automated Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Container vulnerability scanning
   docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     -v $(pwd):/app aquasec/trivy image enterprise-auth:latest
   ```
