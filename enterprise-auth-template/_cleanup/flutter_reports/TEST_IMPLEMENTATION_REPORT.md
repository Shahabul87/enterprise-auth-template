## 🔧 Implementation Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Mock Generation
**Issue**: Some mock files couldn't be generated due to missing imports or type conflicts.
**Solution**: Created comprehensive manual mocks for critical services.

### Challenge 2: API Client Architecture
**Issue**: The API client uses Riverpod dependency injection which complicates unit testing.
**Solution**: Created provider overrides for testing scenarios.

### Challenge 3: Platform-Specific Features
**Issue**: Biometric authentication, device security features are platform-dependent.
**Solution**: Created abstraction layers and platform-aware test conditions.

## 📝 Test Best Practices Implemented

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern**: All tests follow AAA pattern for clarity
2. **Comprehensive Mocking**: Used Mockito for creating test doubles
3. **Test Isolation**: Each test runs independently without side effects
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Covered error scenarios, null cases, and boundary conditions
5. **Descriptive Test Names**: Clear naming convention for test understanding
6. **Group Organization**: Tests organized by feature and functionality
