# ADR-001: State Management Solution

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context
We need a robust state management solution for our Flutter authentication template that can handle complex authentication flows, provide good developer experience, and scale with the application. The solution needs to support dependency injection, testing, and reactive programming patterns.

## Decision Drivers
- Type safety and compile-time checks
- Testability and mockability
- Performance and memory efficiency
- Developer experience and learning curve
- Community support and ecosystem
- Compatibility with Clean Architecture

## Considered Options
1. **Riverpod**: Modern, compile-safe state management
2. **Bloc**: Battle-tested with clear separation of concerns
3. **Provider**: Flutter team's recommended solution
4. **GetX**: All-in-one solution with many features
5. **MobX**: Reactive state management with observables

## Decision Outcome
Chosen option: **Riverpod**, because it provides the best balance of type safety, testability, and developer experience while being compatible with our Clean Architecture approach.

### Positive Consequences
- Compile-time safety prevents runtime errors
- Excellent testing support with ProviderContainer
- Built-in dependency injection
- Automatic disposal of resources
- Great DevTools support
- Can be used outside of Flutter (pure Dart)
- Lazy loading by default
- Granular rebuilds for performance

### Negative Consequences
- Steeper learning curve than Provider
- More boilerplate than GetX
- Newer, so less established patterns
- Documentation still evolving

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Option 1: Riverpod
- **Pros:**
  - Type-safe with no runtime exceptions
  - Compile-time dependency graph validation
  - Testable without Flutter
  - Supports multiple providers of same type
  - Auto-dispose feature
  - Great for Clean Architecture
- **Cons:**
  - Learning curve for advanced features
  - More verbose than some alternatives
  - Requires code generation for some features

### Option 2: Bloc
- **Pros:**
  - Clear separation of business logic and UI
  - Well-established patterns
  - Great for large teams
  - Extensive documentation
  - Predictable state transitions
- **Cons:**
  - More boilerplate code
  - Steeper learning curve
  - Can be overkill for simple apps
  - Requires understanding of streams

### Option 3: Provider
- **Pros:**
  - Official Flutter solution
  - Simple to learn
  - Good documentation
  - Widely adopted
- **Cons:**
  - Runtime errors possible
  - Less type-safe than Riverpod
  - Context dependency
  - Verbose for complex scenarios

### Option 4: GetX
- **Pros:**
  - Minimal boilerplate
  - Many built-in features
  - Easy to learn
  - Good performance
- **Cons:**
  - Too opinionated
  - Breaks some Flutter conventions
  - Harder to test
  - Less type-safe
  - Not ideal for Clean Architecture

### Option 5: MobX
- **Pros:**
  - Reactive programming model
  - Less boilerplate with code generation
  - Good for complex state
- **Cons:**
  - Requires code generation
  - Different mental model
  - Smaller community in Flutter
  - Magic can be hard to debug

## Implementation Notes

### Basic Setup
```dart
// Provider definition
final authStateProvider = StateNotifierProvider<AuthNotifier, AuthState>((ref) {
  return AuthNotifier(ref.watch(authRepositoryProvider));
});

// Usage in widget
class LoginPage extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final authState = ref.watch(authStateProvider);
    // ...
  }
}
```

### Testing
```dart
test('authentication test', () {
  final container = ProviderContainer(
    overrides: [
      authRepositoryProvider.overrideWithValue(MockAuthRepository()),
    ],
  );

  final authState = container.read(authStateProvider);
  // Test logic
});
```
