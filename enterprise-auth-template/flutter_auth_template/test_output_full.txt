══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown building ListTile(onTap: Closure: () => void, dirty):
No Material widget found.
ListTile widgets require a Material widget ancestor within the closest LookupBoundary.
In Material Design, most widgets are conceptually "printed" on a sheet of material. In Flutter's
material library, that material is represented by the Material widget. It is the Material widget
that renders ink splashes, for instance. Because of this, many material library widgets require that
there be a Material widget in the tree above them.
To introduce a Material widget, you can either directly include one, or use a widget that contains
Material itself, such as a Card, Dialog, Drawer, or Scaffold.
The specific widget that could not find a Material ancestor was:
  ListTile
The ancestors of this widget were:
  ...
  RepaintBoundary
  IndexedSemantics
  _SelectionKeepAlive
  NotificationListener<KeepAliveNotification>
  KeepAlive
  ...

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  ListTile

══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown building ListTile(onTap: Closure: () => void, dirty):
No Material widget found.
ListTile widgets require a Material widget ancestor within the closest LookupBoundary.
In Material Design, most widgets are conceptually "printed" on a sheet of material. In Flutter's
material library, that material is represented by the Material widget. It is the Material widget
that renders ink splashes, for instance. Because of this, many material library widgets require that
there be a Material widget in the tree above them.
To introduce a Material widget, you can either directly include one, or use a widget that contains
Material itself, such as a Card, Dialog, Drawer, or Scaffold.
The specific widget that could not find a Material ancestor was:
  ListTile
The ancestors of this widget were:
  ...
  RepaintBoundary
  IndexedSemantics
  _SelectionKeepAlive
  NotificationListener<KeepAliveNotification>
  KeepAlive
  ...

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  ListTile

══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown building ListTile(onTap: Closure: () => void, dirty):
No Material widget found.
ListTile widgets require a Material widget ancestor within the closest LookupBoundary.
In Material Design, most widgets are conceptually "printed" on a sheet of material. In Flutter's
material library, that material is represented by the Material widget. It is the Material widget
that renders ink splashes, for instance. Because of this, many material library widgets require that
there be a Material widget in the tree above them.
To introduce a Material widget, you can either directly include one, or use a widget that contains
Material itself, such as a Card, Dialog, Drawer, or Scaffold.
The specific widget that could not find a Material ancestor was:
  ListTile
The ancestors of this widget were:
  ...
  RepaintBoundary
  IndexedSemantics
  _SelectionKeepAlive
  NotificationListener<KeepAliveNotification>
  KeepAlive
  ...

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  ListTile
  ListTile:file:///Users/mdshahabulalam/basetemplate/enterprise-auth-template/flutter_auth_template/test/core/responsive/adaptive_layouts_test.dart:157:18

══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY WIDGETS LIBRARY ╞═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown building ListTile(onTap: Closure: () => void, dirty):
No Material widget found.
ListTile widgets require a Material widget ancestor within the closest LookupBoundary.
In Material Design, most widgets are conceptually "printed" on a sheet of material. In Flutter's
material library, that material is represented by the Material widget. It is the Material widget
that renders ink splashes, for instance. Because of this, many material library widgets require that
there be a Material widget in the tree above them.
To introduce a Material widget, you can either directly include one, or use a widget that contains
Material itself, such as a Card, Dialog, Drawer, or Scaffold.
The specific widget that could not find a Material ancestor was:
  ListTile
The ancestors of this widget were:
  ...
  RepaintBoundary

══╡ EXCEPTION CAUGHT BY RENDERING LIBRARY ╞═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The following assertion was thrown during layout:
A RenderFlex overflowed by 288 pixels on the right.

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  Row
  Row:file:///Users/mdshahabulalam/basetemplate/enterprise-auth-template/flutter_auth_template/lib/core/responsive/responsive_builder.dart:220:12

The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
like a ListView.
The specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#8b1cd OVERFLOWING:

The following assertion was thrown during layout:
A RenderFlex overflowed by 288 pixels on the right.

The relevant error-causing widget was:
  Row
  Row:file:///Users/mdshahabulalam/basetemplate/enterprise-auth-template/flutter_auth_template/lib/core/responsive/responsive_builder.dart:220:12

The overflowing RenderFlex has an orientation of Axis.horizontal.
The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
black striped pattern. This is usually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.
Consider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget) to force the children of the
RenderFlex to fit within the available space instead of being sized to their natural size.
This is considered an error condition because it indicates that there is content that cannot be
seen. If the content is legitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping it with a
ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using a scrollable container rather than a Flex,
like a ListView.

  Binding has not yet been initialized.
  The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

  Binding has not yet been initialized.
  The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

  Binding has not yet been initialized.
  The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

  Binding has not yet been initialized.
  The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

Error loading pending actions: Binding has not yet been initialized.
The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

Error loading pending actions: Binding has not yet been initialized.
The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

  Binding has not yet been initialized.
  The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.
