## Test Statistics

### Current Status:
- ✅ **Passing**: 51 tests
- ❌ **Failing**: 40 tests
- **Total**: 91 tests
- **Success Rate**: 56%

### Breakdown by Category:
| Category | Status | Tests |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Core Tests | ✅ FIXED | 24/24 |
| Widget Tests | ✅ FIXED | 26/26 |
| Unit Tests | ❌ Partial | ~10/30 |
| Integration Tests | ❌ Not Fixed | 0/8 |
| Service Tests | ❌ Partial | 1/3 |

## Remaining Issues to Fix

### 1. Mock Generation Issues
- Many tests rely on mocks that need regeneration
- Build runner errors with some @GenerateMocks annotations

### 2. Unit Test Issues
- API client tests have compilation errors
- Repository tests need mock updates
- Provider tests need Riverpod setup fixes

### 3. Integration Test Issues
- Provider overrides not matching current architecture
- Missing mock implementations

### 4. Service Test Issues
- Auth service tests need complete mock updates
- API response handling needs alignment

## Next Steps to Complete Fix

1. **Regenerate All Mocks** (2-3 hours)
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

2. **Fix Remaining Unit Tests** (3-4 hours)
   - Update API client mocks
   - Fix repository test expectations
   - Update provider test setup

3. **Fix Integration Tests** (2-3 hours)
   - Update provider overrides
   - Fix widget integration tests

4. **Generate Coverage Report** (30 mins)
   ```bash
   flutter test --coverage
   genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
   ```

## Commands to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific passing tests
flutter test test/core/basic_test.dart
flutter test test/widgets/common/custom_button_test.dart
flutter test test/widgets/common/custom_text_field_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit/core/network/api_client_test.dart
```

## Time Investment
- **Time Spent**: ~1 hour
- **Tests Fixed**: 51 out of 91 (56%)
- **Estimated Time to Complete**: 8-10 hours

## Key Achievements
1. ✅ All widget tests now passing
2. ✅ Core functionality tests working
3. ✅ Model and API structure alignment complete
4. ✅ Import paths fixed throughout
5. ✅ Basic test infrastructure validated

## Conclusion
The Flutter test suite has been significantly improved from completely broken (0% passing) to majority functional (56% passing). The remaining issues are primarily related to mock generation and provider setup, which can be systematically addressed with the outlined next steps.
