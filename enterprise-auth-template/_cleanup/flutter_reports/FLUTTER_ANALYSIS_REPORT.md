///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final result = await loginUseCase.execute('user@example.com', 'password');
/// ```
```

### 5. Testing Strategy (Score: 8.5/10)

#### Current Coverage Analysis
```
Unit Tests:        ✅ Good (65% coverage)
Widget Tests:      ✅ Present but limited
Integration Tests: ✅ Key flows covered
E2E Tests:        ⚠️ Missing

Target: 80% unit, 60% widget, key integration tests
```

#### 🔄 Testing Improvements Needed
1. Increase unit test coverage to 80%+
2. Add more widget tests for custom components
3. Implement E2E tests for critical paths
4. Add mutation testing for test quality

### 6. Performance Optimization (Score: 8.7/10)

#### ✅ Current Optimizations
- Lazy loading with GoRouter
- Image caching with CachedNetworkImage
- API response caching with Dio interceptors

#### 🔄 Missing Industry Standards
```dart
// Recommended: Add performance monitoring
class PerformanceMonitor {
  static final _tracker = FirebasePerformance.instance;

  static Future<T> trackAsync<T>(
    String name,
    Future<T> Function() operation,
  ) async {
    final trace = _tracker.newTrace(name);
    await trace.start();
    try {
      return await operation();
    } finally {
      await trace.stop();
    }
  }
}
```
