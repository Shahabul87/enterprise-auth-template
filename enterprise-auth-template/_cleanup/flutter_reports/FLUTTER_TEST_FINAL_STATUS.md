**Status**: COMPLETED
- Fixed auth_repository_impl_test.dart
- Updated constructor calls from named to positional parameters
- Replaced obsolete models (UserResponse → User)
- Fixed all model field names

### 2. **Regenerated Mocks** ✅
**Requirement**: Regenerate all mock files
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Successfully ran `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- 8 mock files regenerated
- Mock implementations now match current interfaces

### 3. **Updated Test Models** ✅
**Requirement**: Align test models with actual implementation
**Status**: COMPLETED
- User model: Added required fields (roles, permissions, isTwoFactorEnabled)
- RegisterRequest: Updated fields (name → fullName, added confirmPassword)
- ResetPasswordRequest: Fixed field names (newPassword → password)
- AuthResponse: Using correct structure with AuthResponseData

### 4. **Fixed Exception Types** ✅
**Requirement**: Remove non-existent exception types
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Removed UnauthorizedException, ConflictException
- Now using proper AppException factories:
  - `.authentication()` for auth errors
  - `.network()` for network errors
  - `.validation()` for validation errors
